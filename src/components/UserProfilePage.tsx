I grew up here in Singapore, and I‚Äôve always been curious about how things work‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs computers, gadgets, or even how cities are designed. Outside of class, I like tutoring high school students in coding and exploring new tech tools that make life easier. ",
      "People often assume that being ‚Äúvisually impaired‚Äù is one single experience, but it‚Äôs actually very different for each person. For me, I have a bit of residual vision‚ÄîI can sense light and make out large shapes, but I can‚Äôt rely on it for reading or moving around safely. Most of the time, I use a white cane to get from place to place, and a screen reader for studying and daily tasks. ",
      "Of course, that doesn‚Äôt mean every day is simple. Sometimes it takes me longer to do things that others don‚Äôt even think twice about, like setting up a new device or finding the right classroom. But I‚Äôve learned to problem-solve, and over time, I‚Äôve become pretty good at using technology to manage on my own. ",
      "That‚Äôs why independence is something I value a lot. I don‚Äôt like depending too much on others for everyday things, so I‚Äôm always looking for tools or systems that give me more control. Looking ahead, I don‚Äôt want to be boxed into a narrow idea of what someone like me can or cannot do. I want to try different jobs, take on different roles, and keep proving‚Äîto myself and to others‚Äîthat my possibilities are not defined by my vision. "

This is my first time in Singapore, and almost everything feels new‚Äîthe food, the weather, the way classes are taught, even how people hang out after school. It‚Äôs exciting, but honestly, it can also feel overwhelming.",
      "Every day brings something unfamiliar. Sometimes it‚Äôs the little things, like figuring out which bus to take, or learning how the library system works. Other times, it‚Äôs bigger things, my English is not very good, so lectures, group projects, and even everyday conversations feel tough. Sometimes I understand the ideas, but I can‚Äôt find the right words quickly enough. So I often pause before speaking, wondering if I‚Äôll say something wrong.",
      "Still, I try to see all of this as part of the experience. I‚Äôve started to ask more questions, to observe, and to let myself learn slowly. Working part-time as a barista near campus has helped too‚Äîit gives me a chance to meet people outside the classroom and pick up new words and habits along the way.",
      "What matters most to me during this exchange is growing through these new experiences. I want to explore, make friends, and discover what it feels like to be part of this community. Even if it‚Äôs scary sometimes, I believe these moments of adjustment are where real learning happens."

Outside of class, I volunteer with a youth mentoring program, which I really enjoy because it lets me connect with younger students and share some of my own experiences.",
      "Something important to know about me is that I have ADHD. For me, that means focusing for a long time is tough, especially when there‚Äôs too much information coming at once. My mind tends to jump from one thought to another quickly. Sometimes it feels like I‚Äôm juggling too many tabs open in my head at the same time.",
      "Of course, it can be frustrating when I lose track of deadlines or forget small tasks. But over time, I‚Äôve learned different ways to cope‚Äîusing reminders on my phone, breaking down tasks, and leaning on friends who keep me accountable. And in other situations, this fast, energetic way of thinking actually helps me‚Äîlike when I need to brainstorm ideas or handle unexpected changes.",
      "What I value most is the chance to put my energy into something meaningful. I don‚Äôt want my challenges to define what I can or cannot do. Instead, I want to find spaces where my creativity, energy, and perspective are useful. For me, success isn‚Äôt about doing everything perfectly‚Äîit‚Äôs about discovering where I can contribute, and learning how to turn my way of thinking into a strength."

Whether it‚Äôs guiding someone through the databases or simply recommending a good book, I like being part of their learning journey.",

My job often requires me to stand at the front desk, walk around the library, or move books and equipment. These days, I get tired more quickly, and I‚Äôve had to learn to pace myself.",

I also find myself thinking more about the future‚Äînot only for my own family but also about how environments and systems can better support people going through different life situations.",
